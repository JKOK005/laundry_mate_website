# Laundry mate is an integrated solution for users to dry their laundry
### This was done for the P&G distrupt the laundry tech challenge
### Our team clinched 3rd place in the competition, out of 15 participating teams internationally 

Laundry mate uses data analytics and syncs with the user's calendar on Google calendar in order to 
advise the user on the best time to wash and dry his clothes. 

We also develop a recommendation system that advises users on suitable laundry products to use for his load.

The data collected from subscribed users can be used to understand various patterns such as user washing 
habits across different demographics and geographical locations. This can be used by companies for target
advertising or resource planning. 

Laundry mate consists of:
1. App (in Android) that the user interacts to plan his washing and drying schedule 
2. Web dashboard, in Django, HTML/CSS/JQuery, for visualization of user washing patters across countries
3. Backend machine learning and data storage in Microsoft Azure

In this repository, you will only find **items 2&3**.
